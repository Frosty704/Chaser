Chaser
======

App and FFGL plugin to quickly create chasers on layers in Resolume

Chaser consists of two parts.

The app part can load a Resolume Advanced Output setup .xml file. It will display the Input Selection slices.

You can then assign slices to steps of a sequencer and save this data to a .xml file.

The plugin part can load this .xml file, and animate the sequence based on a exposed speed parameter.
